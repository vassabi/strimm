        <h6>1.	Copyright of Strimm proprietary content</h6>
        <p>With the exception of your Original User-Generated Content, you are not granted any rights, title, interest, or license, or ownership including any copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to any Content, other than as explicitly set forth in this policy. Such content on the Site, including without limitation, the text, software, graphics, photos, posts, and any Strimm-owned and hosted videos, which are owned by or licensed to Strimm, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights and trademark laws, trade secret laws, foreign laws, and international conventions. Other than as specifically permitted, you may not engage in the unauthorized use, broadcasting, copying, distribution, or any other form of exploitation of Strimm’s Content. All copyright, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights in the Site (including the design, arrangement, and look and feel) and all material or Content supplied as part of the Site, other than User-Generated Content, shall remain at all times the property of Strimm. </p>


        <h6>2.	Limited License of User-Generated Content</h6>
        <p>
            By posting any Content on the Site, you grant to Strimm, Strimm’s affiliates, agents, and assignees a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, paid-in-full, royalty-free license in all of the User IP (as defined below) for the purpose of operating the Site and performing the functions permitted by the Site. “User IP” means any copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and all other intellectual property belonging to a User and contained in Content posted on the Site by such User.  
        </p>




        <h6>3.	 Copyright of Third-Party Content </h6>



        <p>Strimm is a video platform, which provides a User-Generated Content to the public. Strimm respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our Users to do the same. It is strictly the Users’ responsibility to ensure that they are complying with the applicable copyright laws, and this copyright policy should not be a substitute for professional legal advice. </p>

        <p>You acknowledge and agree to not link or upload or use in any other way any Content on Strimm, from a third-party website or source, including, without limitation, YouTube, Daily Motion, or Vimeo (collectively, “Third-Party Source”), which is taken from the Third-Party Source without their authorization to use this Content outside of the Third-Party Source. </p>

        <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that if you create a channel or a playlist with videos from a Third-Party Source, you do not upload or download videos onto your account on the Site, without authorization from Strimm. You simply create a link to their server, where the publicly shared video is located and is being streamed from. The video is also played on such Third-Party Source’s embedded player. Since these Third-Party Sources allow embedding most of their videos and players on any public website, we use their embedding function to play their videos on the Site and to allow scheduling a playlist. Only videos, which are allowed to be embedded and used by these Third-Party Source on public sites and which are not restricted by them can be played on Strimm. While some videos posted on a Third-Party Source may infringe someone’s intellectual property rights, it is only under their control to respond to any allegations of infringement. If the Content added to your channel becomes restricted or removed by any of these Third-Party Sources, a relevant message will appear in the video box, preventing you from using this Content.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, you acknowledge and agree that if you broadcast Content on the Site, it is your sole responsibility to comply with all applicable laws. By using the Site or Services, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to broadcast all of your User-Generated Content on the Site or through the Services. </p>
            <h6>4.	Infringement Allegations</h6>

            <p>If you are a copyright owner of Content displayed through the Site and you have not authorized such display, we encourage you to contact the relevant Third-Party Source directly. We have absolutely no way to remove it from any Third-Party Source’s servers. If the Content is playing on our Site, then it is playing on the site of the Third-Party Source, as well and on any other site in which the Content is embedded. You can file a complaint, directly on such Third-Party Source’s website.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you would like to submit (or respond to) a request to remove any Content for any purpose, please visit and follow the instructions on our <a href="notice-and-takedown">Notice and Takedown Policy page</a>.</p>
