       <h6> Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement</h6>

<p>NOTE: THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR NOTIFYING US THAT YOUR COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL MAY HAVE BEEN INFRINGED. ALL OTHER INQUIRIES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE THROUGH THIS PROCESS.</p>

<p>First, please verify where your content is originally hosted. Most channels hosted on this website utilize content previously uploaded and hosted on servers not affiliated with Strimm, such as Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, or users’ private servers. If content is not hosted on the Strimm server directly, then we have no means to remove it from the original location. We can only remove the link to the third-party server. </p>

<p>If you believe that your copyright has been infringed on this website, written notification must be submitted to the following DMCA Designated Agent:</p>

            <p class="copyrightsAddress">LEGAL DEPARTMENT</p>
            <p class="copyrightsAddress">113 McHenry Rd., #147, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089 USA</p>
            <p class="copyrightsAddress">Telephone: 847.305.3045</p>
            <p class="copyrightsAddress"><a href="mailto:legal@strimm.com" class="copyrightInformation" target="_blank">legal@strimm.com</a></p>

<p>You can also do so using the webform located at <a href="contact-us">Contact Us</a> ( https://www.strimm.com/contact-us ).</p>

<p>To be effective, the notification must include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>1.	A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>2.	Identification of all copyrighted works claimed to have been infringed;</li>
<li>3.	Identification of all the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or to which access is to be disabled;</li>
<li>4.	The uniform resource locator(s) (URLs) where the allegedly defamatory content is hosted (or other information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material);</li>
<li>5.	The name of the channel on this website containing the allegedly infringing material and the user names of the users in control of the channel;</li>
<li>6.	Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;</li>
<li>7.	A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or any applicable law; and</li>
<li>8.	A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you file your copyright infringement notification, please carefully consider whether or not the use of the copyrighted material at issue is protected by doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other applicable exceptions to copyright protection.</p>  

<p>Under certain circumstances, if you file a DMCA takedown notice when there is no infringing use, you could be liable for costs and attorneys’ fees. If you are unsure whether someone’s use of the material in question amounts to infringement, you should contact an attorney. You may also want to consult publicly available reference materials such as those found at the U.S. Copyright Office  (https://www.copyright.gov/).</p>



<h6>Procedure for Providing Counter-Notices Pursuant to the DMCA</h6>

<p> Counter-notice is a legal request for Strimm to reinstate a video that has been removed for alleged copyright infringement. The process may only be pursued in instances where the upload was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. It should not be pursued under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>Counter-notices must be submitted by the video’s original uploader or an agent authorized to act on their behalf, such as an attorney. To submit a counter-notice, written notification must be submitted to the following DMCA Designated Agent:</p>


            <p class="copyrightsAddress">LEGAL DEPARTMENT</p>
            <p class="copyrightsAddress">113 McHenry Rd., #147, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089 USA</p>

            <p class="copyrightsAddress"><a href="mailto:support@strimm.com" class="copyrightInformation" target="_blank">legal@strimm.com</a></p>

<p>You can also do so using the webform located at <a href="contact-us">Contact Us</a>  (https://www.strimm.com/contact-us) .</p>

<p>You will also need to provide the following information:</p>
        <ol>
<li>1)	A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the responder to the allegations of copyright infringement;</li>
<li>2)	Identification of all copyrighted works claimed to have been infringed;</li>
<li>3)	A statement that you have formed a good faith belief that the material was removed as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the identified material;</li>
<li>4)	Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;</li>
<li>5)	A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is either non-infringing of any third party’s copyrights or authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or any applicable law; and</li>
<li>6)	A statement that the information in the counter-notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the responder.</li>
</ol>
<p>After we process your counter notification by forwarding it to the claimant, the claimant has 10 business days to provide us with evidence that they have initiated a court action to keep the content down. This time period is a requirement of copyright law, so please be patient.</p>
