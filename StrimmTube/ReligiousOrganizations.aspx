<p>We all need the guidance of a higher power. The study of God never ends, we are forever His students.  Sometimes though, life gets in the way, and for a variety of reasons, health, work, travel we are unable to attend an event, a sermon, a Bible or a Torah study, a service or a ceremony. Other times you were very moved and want to revisit one of those proceedings. Strimm TV’s revolutionary technology now delivers the opportunity to do just that!</p>
<p>Television has been one of the most successful education and entertainment tools of the last decades, but, until now, a custom TV channel was affordable and accessible to large organizations only. Strimm TV has transformed what we know as TV and created a new niche, Private Online Television. </p>
<p> Unlike traditional TV, Strimm TV is inexpensive and available to all.  Internet channels can be watched from anywhere in the world, on any device, at any time. Gone are the restrictions!  Compared to click-to-play videos, there is no need to stack your website with dozens of videos and frustrate your community. One screen, one player, any message, any time.
