        Dear  <b>{firstName}</b>,<br /><br />
        We know, it happens! We’ve received a notification from PayPal that the recurring subscription payment for your TV channel has failed. We cannot resubmit your payment for Strimm services. Please contact PayPal in regards to this issue and resubmit the payment as soon as possible to avoid service interruption and subscription cancellation. If subscription is canceled, then your TV channel will completely disappear from your website and your viewers will start missing it.
        <br />
        <br />
        PayPal will attempt to resubmit the payment automatically one more time in the next few days. If it fails again, our system will automatically block your TV channel from being embedded and displayed on your website.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please let us know when the situation is resolved with Paypal and the payment is resubmitted.
        <br />
