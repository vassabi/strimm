        Dear  <b>{firstName}</b>,<br /><br />
        We were notified that you have decided to cancel your channel embedding subscription. Your subscription will be canceled per your request. Please note that unless you simply changed the level of your subscription, your channel will disappear from your website but will still play on Strimm.com per your scheduled programming.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also, if you purchased several subscriptions and cancelled some of them, please visit your channels’ settings area and manually unselect channels you do not want to be embedded. Otherwise, our system will unselect the latest embedded channels automatically to the allowed number of channels per subscription/s.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the reason for the cancellation was to change the subscription package, then please expect the current subscription to be canceled and a new one to be activated per your request.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please let us know when the situation is resolved with Paypal and the payment is resubmitted.
        <br />
        <br />
