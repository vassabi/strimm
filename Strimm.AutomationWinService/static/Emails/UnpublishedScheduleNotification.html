        Dear  <b>{firstName}</b>,<br /><br />
        This is a friendly reminder that you have a scheduled playlist in the "{channelName}" channel, <br />
        which is supposed to broadcast on {startDate} at {startTime}, but remains "unpublished". <br />
        If you wish to broadcast the playlist as scheduled, please visit the Schedule Page of your channel.<br />
        Then select the date in the calendar (on top) and click PUBLISH. This playlist will then go live as scheduled.<br /><br />
        Please review the Schedule Page video tutorial if you  have any questions.<br /><br />
        Best regards,<br /><br />
        Strimm Support Team<br />
